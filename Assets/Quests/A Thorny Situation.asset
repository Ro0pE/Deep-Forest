  description: "Near the forest\u2019s edge, strange cactus-like creatures have started
    sprouting where they don\u2019t belong. They\u2019re not just weird\u2014they\u2019re
    dropping sharp thorns everywhere! Collect their thorny cores to stop the spread
    and clean up the area."
  completeText: "Great job clearing out those strange cactus creatures! With their
    thorny cores removed, the forest\u2019s edge is safe again, and the paths are
    much easier to walk without those nasty thorns everywhere. Thanks for cleaning
    up the mess!"
