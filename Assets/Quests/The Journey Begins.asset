    the forest. You should be careful\u2014this place is not as safe as it once was. 
    Strange creatures have started appearing, and no one knows where they came from.
    They attack without reason, and one of them even stole something precious from
    me\u2014my necklace.  You look like someone who can handle themselves. Please,
    if you\u2019re willing, could you retrieve my necklace from those creatures?"

    something tells me this is only the beginning of our troubles.  I was going to
    keep this necklace, but I believe you will need it more than I will in the days
    to come. Take it\u2014may it protect you on your journey.  Also, take these potions.
    The road ahead will not be easy, and you\u2019ll need all the help you can get."
