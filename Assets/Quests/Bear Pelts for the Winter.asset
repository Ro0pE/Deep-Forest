  title: Bear Pelts for the Winter
  description: "\"The harsh winter is approaching, and our village needs warm clothing
    to survive. The bears of the forest have thick, luxurious pelts that would make
    excellent winter gear, but they\u2019re not going to give them up easily.  I
    need you to hunt down a few bears and bring me their pelts. The thicker the fur,
    the better. It\u2019s dangerous work, but if you succeed, the village will be
    warm and safe throughout the season. Just be ready\u2014the forest is full of
    angry bears, and they won\u2019t take kindly to being hunted.\""
  completeText: "By the gods, you actually did it! These pelts are perfect\u2014thick
    and warm, just what we need for the coming cold. You\u2019ve done more for this
    village than you know. With these, we can make coats, blankets, and more to survive
    the winter. Take this reward as thanks for your bravery and skill."
