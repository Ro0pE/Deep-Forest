  title: Damn bears!
  description: "\"The bears have been terrorizing my wife, Joanna, and ruining our
    blueberry harvest. They come at night, clawing through the woods and devouring
    every berry in sight. I\u2019ve tried to stop them, but they\u2019re too strong. 
    Please, hunt down these cursed bears and bring me their fangs as proof. But beware,
    there\u2019s a massive white bear in the area\u2014it's more dangerous than the
    rest, and I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s been acting strange. Stay clear of it if
    you value your life!\""
  completeText: "Ah, you\u2019ve returned! I can see by the look on your face that
    the bears are no more. And you\u2019ve brought their fangs as proof, just as
    I asked. You\u2019ve done a great service to this village and to Joanna, who
    can finally rest easy. We are forever in your debt. Please, take this as a token
    of our gratitude."
